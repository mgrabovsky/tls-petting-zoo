# TLS Petting Zoo

This repository contains code samples demonstrating how to establish a TLS connection
and submit a simple HTTP request to a remote server in C and Python. The samples
each use a different TLS-capable library: [GnuTLS 3.6.10][gnutls],
libtls from [LibreSSL 2.9.2][libressl], [pyOpenSSL][pyopenssl] and the
[`ssl` module][python-ssl] from the Python 3 standard library
